# Java-Sorting-Benchmark
This project benchmarks the performance of two classic sorting algorithms — Heap Sort and Insertion Sort — by analyzing operation counts and execution time. It also includes a Swing-based GUI to visualize results.

## Features
* Heap Sort and Insertion Sort implementations

* Benchmarks over increasing data sizes (12x40 test cases)

* Generates output files with counts and timing

* GUI report viewer using Swing (ReportGenerator)

* Calculates average and coefficient of variation
